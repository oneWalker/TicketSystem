# TicketSystem

Without the knowledge of MVC,the location of files in the project looks a little mess.

There are 3 different users in the project ,which is admins ,cinemas worker and customers.

Logining on the system with different users,we have different functions.

The UI design of project refers from https://almsaeedstudio.com/themes/AdminLTE/documentation/index.html.

Due to the lack of UI skills, the shortage of the web don't hidden the extra functions.Of course,if you don't have the functions,you can't use them.

If you have better solution ,advice and any problems about the web project, welcome to contact with me by email.
