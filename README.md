# TicketSystem
## Introduce and Background

There are 3 different users in the project ,which is admins ,cinemas worker and customers.

Logining on the system with different users,we have different functions.

The UI design of project refers from https://almsaeedstudio.com/themes/AdminLTE/documentation/index.html.

## How to Run it?
You can download the programming and set app.js as the main file.
the sql, named dbms.sql is the whole database froms.
```bash
> npm install
>npm run main
or node app.js
```
## Need to be good
+ Without the knowledge of MVC,the location of files in the project looks a little mess.
+ Due to the lack of UI skills, the shortage of the web don't hidden the extra functions.Of course,if you don't have the functions,you can't use them.

## The last
If you have any better ways to make it better, please no hesitate to give me the advice.
